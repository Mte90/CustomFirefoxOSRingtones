RingTone-Picker-for-FirefoxOS 
========================

A FirefoxOS app for set a custom ringtone on Firefox OS < 1.3

This is a "system" app, so you won't see an icon on the homescreen
when you install it.  After installing, open the Settings app and
click on Sound. Then tap to change your ringtone. You should get a
choice of "System Ringtones" or "My Ringtones".  That second option is
this app. Select it, and you'll see (and hear) new ringtone options!

To uninstall the app use Settings -> App Permissions.
